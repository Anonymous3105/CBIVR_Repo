	Function to return features extracted from the gray level co-occurrence matrix of an image
	:param image: OpenCV numpy array_like of uint8
	:param distances: array_like
		List of pixel pair distance offsets
	:param angles: array_like
		List of pixel pair angles in radians.
	:param levels: int, optional
		The input image should contain integers in [0, levels-1],
		where levels indicate the number of grey-levels counted (typically 256 for an 8-bit image). Default= 256.
	:param symmetric: bool, optional
		If True, the output matrix P[:, :, d, theta] is symmetric.
		This is accomplished by ignoring the order of value pairs,
		so both (i, j) and (j, i) are accumulated when (i, j) is encountered for a given offset. Default= False.
	:param normed: bool, optional
		If True, normalize each matrix P[:, :, d, theta] by dividing by
		the total number of accumulated co-occurrences for the given offset.
		The elements of the resulting matrix sum to 1. Default= False.
	:param features: array_like
		The list of desired features that can be extracted from GLCM matrix.
		Accepted values for array elements include:
