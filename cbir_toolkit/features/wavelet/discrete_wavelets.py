	Function to compute 3-level DWT RGB planes of an image. The function operates on the following algorithm:
		1. Split the RGB image into individual planes
		2. For each color plane, decompose the plane using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to the 3rd level
		3. For each obtained band in the 3rd level decomposition compute features like mean, standard deviation & entropy.
		4. Follow the same procedure for the Green and Blue color.
